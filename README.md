# Recipes Readme 

## In this project I create a crude recipe database.
I cement my HTML knowledge and skills by applying them to this recipe repository:

* Creating a basic HTML website.
* Creating multiple pages with rich content.
* Creating different view options for the audience to access the site's content.
